# project8_task_auth

**project8_task_auth** 

The task_auth project build with php 7. It uses cookies and JWT to secure the tasks each user created. This project is part of my learning journey with teamtreehouse.com php tech degree. It demonstrates my ability to use jwt and cookies to provide authentication and authorization services to a system. 

Note: 

Teamtreehouse.com PHP Techdegree exceeding grade changes: auto login after signup, use jwt to secure the cookies.
